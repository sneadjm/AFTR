This project is a personal side project that reminds users of important birthdays and provides a quick cache of relevant pictures of the person of honor for use in posts/stories. 

The app is made using a Python backend and React JS frontend. </br>

The final product will have the following functionality:
- Users register accounts with email/password
- Users add friends/family (will just refer to all as "friends" as umbrella moving forward) to database with a representative picture and birthday
- App checks database daily to pull any friends that have a birthday today
- If there is a friend with the birthday, app will parse user's photos (if given permission) to pull photos of the friend and remind user of friend's birthday with notifications.
